- June 26, 2025: Updated MAVLink service to default to real device data on startup - system now attempts to connect to actual drone hardware first, with automatic fallback to simulation if connection fails
- June 26, 2025: Integrated real MAVLink libraries - installed `mavlink` and `serialport` packages to replace custom simulation with actual MAVLink protocol communication for genuine drone hardware compatibility
- June 27, 2025: Successfully implemented COM4 serial port connection - system now properly connects to real drone hardware on COM4 with 57600 baud rate, receiving live telemetry data including GPS position, attitude, and battery status
- June 27, 2025: Implemented cloud deployment compatibility - added network-based MAVLink connections (UDP/TCP) for cloud environments where serial ports are unavailable, created comprehensive deployment guide with connection options and troubleshooting
- June 27, 2025: Created development bridge solution - built com-bridge.js tool to forward local COM4 serial data to cloud environment via UDP, enabling real hardware testing during cloud development with simple `node com-bridge.js` command
- June 27, 2025: Implemented cloud bridge system - created cloud-bridge.js for HTTP-based connection from local hardware to cloud, added real-time bridge monitoring in Settings page, and comprehensive testing guides for verifying COM4 â†’ cloud data flow

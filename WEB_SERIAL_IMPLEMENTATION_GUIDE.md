# Web Serial API Implementation Guide

## Overview

The Web Serial API implementation replaces the cloud bridge system with direct browser-to-drone communication, eliminating the need for local bridge applications and providing real-time MAVLink data processing directly in Chrome.

## Browser Requirements

- **Chrome 89+** or **Edge 89+** (required for Web Serial API support)
- HTTPS connection or localhost development environment
- User gesture required for serial port access (security requirement)

## Key Features

### Direct Hardware Connection
- Browser directly communicates with drone flight controllers via USB
- Eliminates need for cloud-bridge.js or com-bridge.js
- Real-time MAVLink packet parsing and processing
- Automatic drone discovery and telemetry updates

### MAVLink Protocol Support
- **Heartbeat (Message ID 0)**: Drone status and connectivity
- **Global Position (Message ID 33)**: GPS coordinates and altitude
- **Attitude (Message ID 30)**: Roll, pitch, yaw orientation
- **Battery Status (Message ID 147)**: Power system telemetry

### User Interface
- Connection status indicator with real-time updates
- Configurable baud rate selection (9600 to 921600)
- Data transfer statistics (bytes sent/received)
- Drone selection dropdown with live telemetry display
- Connection instructions and troubleshooting guidance

## Implementation Components

### Frontend Components

#### useWebSerial Hook (`client/src/hooks/useWebSerial.ts`)
- Manages Web Serial API connection lifecycle
- Handles MAVLink frame parsing (v1.0 and v2.0 protocols)
- Provides connection state management and error handling
- Sends parsed packets to backend for processing

#### Web Serial UAS Page (`client/src/pages/web-serial-uas.tsx`)
- Complete UAS control interface with Web Serial integration
- Real-time telemetry display for connected drones
- Connection management and configuration options
- Live data statistics and diagnostic information

### Backend Integration

#### MAVLink Processing Endpoint (`/api/mavlink/process`)
- Processes Web Serial MAVLink packets from frontend
- Parses payload data based on message ID
- Updates drone telemetry in database
- Integrates with existing MAVLink service architecture

#### Enhanced MAVLink Service
- Public `handleMAVLinkMessage` method for Web Serial integration
- Maintains compatibility with cloud bridge system
- Processes both bridge and Web Serial data streams

## Connection Workflow

### 1. Browser Compatibility Check
```javascript
const isSupported = 'serial' in navigator;
```

### 2. Port Selection and Connection
```javascript
const port = await navigator.serial.requestPort({
  filters: [
    { usbVendorId: 0x26AC }, // Pixhawk
    { usbVendorId: 0x0483 }, // STMicroelectronics
    { usbVendorId: 0x1209 }, // ArduPilot
  ]
});

await port.open({
  baudRate: 57600,
  dataBits: 8,
  stopBits: 1,
  parity: 'none'
});
```

### 3. MAVLink Frame Detection
```javascript
// MAVLink 1.0: Start byte 0xFE
// MAVLink 2.0: Start byte 0xFD
const MAVLINK_STX = 0xFE;
const MAVLINK_STX_V2 = 0xFD;
```

### 4. Packet Processing Pipeline
1. Raw serial data received from drone
2. MAVLink frame parsing and validation
3. Payload extraction based on message ID
4. HTTP POST to `/api/mavlink/process` endpoint
5. Backend processing through MAVLink service
6. Database update with telemetry data
7. WebSocket broadcast to connected clients

## Testing Procedure

### Prerequisites
- Chrome 89+ browser
- Drone with MAVLink-compatible flight controller
- USB connection to computer
- Flight controller powered and active

### Step-by-Step Testing

#### 1. Access Web Serial UAS Page
- Navigate to `/web-serial-uas` in the application
- Verify "Web Serial Supported" badge appears
- Check that connection controls are enabled

#### 2. Configure Connection
- Select appropriate baud rate (typically 57600 for most autopilots)
- Ensure drone is connected via USB and powered on
- Verify flight controller is active and responsive

#### 3. Establish Connection
- Click "Connect to Drone" button
- Grant permission when Chrome prompts for serial access
- Select your flight controller from the device list
- Monitor connection status indicator

#### 4. Verify Data Flow
- Check "Connection Statistics" for increasing byte counts
- Monitor "Last Message" section for recent packet information
- Verify drone appears in UAS selection dropdown
- Confirm telemetry data updates in real-time

#### 5. Validate Telemetry
- **Position Data**: GPS coordinates and altitude updates
- **Attitude Data**: Roll, pitch, yaw orientation changes
- **Power System**: Battery level and voltage readings
- **Flight Data**: Ground speed, heading, and flight mode

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- **Browser Not Supported**: Upgrade to Chrome 89+ or Edge 89+
- **Permission Denied**: Ensure user clicks button (gesture required)
- **Device Not Found**: Check USB connection and flight controller power
- **Wrong Baud Rate**: Try different rates (57600, 115200, 9600)

### Data Issues
- **No Telemetry**: Verify MAVLink output enabled on flight controller
- **Intermittent Data**: Check USB cable quality and connection
- **Wrong Messages**: Confirm flight controller MAVLink version compatibility

### Performance Optimization
- **High CPU Usage**: Reduce data transmission rate on flight controller
- **Memory Issues**: Restart browser if connection becomes unstable
- **Network Load**: Web Serial bypasses network entirely

## Security Considerations

### User Consent Required
- Web Serial API requires explicit user gesture for port access
- No automatic connection without user permission
- Port access limited to specific vendor IDs

### Data Privacy
- All communication remains local between browser and hardware
- No cloud transmission of raw serial data
- User maintains full control over data sharing

## Advantages Over Cloud Bridge

### Simplified Setup
- No additional software installation required
- No local bridge applications to manage
- Direct browser-to-hardware communication

### Improved Performance
- Eliminates network latency in data path
- Direct USB communication for faster response
- Reduced system resource usage

### Enhanced Security
- No network exposure of serial data
- User-controlled access permissions
- Local-only data processing

### Better User Experience
- Integrated connection management
- Real-time connection status
- Native browser integration

## Migration from Cloud Bridge

### Existing Bridge Users
- Web Serial UAS page provides equivalent functionality
- No changes required to drone or flight controller setup
- Improved connection reliability and performance

### Deployment Compatibility
- Cloud bridge system remains available for non-Chrome browsers
- Web Serial provides enhanced experience for supported browsers
- Automatic detection of browser capabilities

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Multiple simultaneous drone connections
- Flight controller configuration interface
- Mission upload/download capabilities
- Real-time parameter adjustment

### Protocol Extensions
- Support for additional MAVLink message types
- Custom payload parsing for specialized drones
- Integration with manufacturer-specific protocols

This implementation provides a modern, secure, and user-friendly approach to drone connectivity that leverages the latest web platform capabilities while maintaining compatibility with existing systems.
